## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
This Jupyter Notebook is dedicated to the analysis of Airbnb data in Boston. We will explore various aspects of this dataset to gain insights into the Boston Airbnb market, including pricing trends, property types, neighborhood popularity, and more.
We will answer the following questions:

1. What are the most popular destinations in Boston?
2. What are the most popular property type?
3. How does pricing vary across neighborhoods?
4. How does pricing vary across property types?
5. Which months of the year have the highest volume of reservations?
6. How has the number of listings evolved over the years?
7. How the price changes over the years?

Through data visualization and statistical analysis, we will aim to provide data-driven answers to these questions and more.
